I am 24 years old. I am an electrical engineer by profession, but have more than 2 years of experience as a software engineer in industry. 
But over time, I realized that web programming was more interesting to me, and I decided to relearn it myself. Having been doing this for more than six months, I discovered this course, and decided that this was a great opportunity for me to learn and apply knowledge immediately. I am well acquainted with LAD programming. I understand databases and SQL. I have a certificate of completion of ABAP courses in the SAP system. There is basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS, Photoshop, git. All my programming experience has been training courses and sites like freecodecamp and codeacademy or htmlacademy. I graduated from BNTU with a degree in electrical engineering and graduated from SAP ABAP courses at LeverX. I have Pre-Intermediate (A2) English level.
